# Inspection in Sector 723

[My submission](https://stiggstogg.itch.io/sector723) to [Gamedev.js Jam 2021](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevjs-2021).

This is a two player cooperative HTML5 game where you need to work together to deceive the mighty Inspector and maintain the freedom in Sector 723!

This game can only be played on a desktop computer with a decent keyboard :).
